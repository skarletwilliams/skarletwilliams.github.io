    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <img src="images/prof_grad_photo.jpg" alt="Photo of Skarlet at Graduation">
    <p> Hello! My name is Skarlet Williams. I'm a software engineer, gamer, and artist.
    My free time is spent watching YouTube and Dropout.tv, drawing, playing games, and reading books. The games I am currently playing mostly consist of Tears of The Kingdom and Into The Breach. I love playing small games on itch.io and Steam to get ideas and spread the love, but aside from PC games I have a soft spot for the Nintendo Switch. My most played game of all time is Dead Cells, an Indie game I bought in highschool that ended up exploding in popularity. </p>

    <p>I graduated from Boise State University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Minor in Mathematics in December 2024. I am passionate about problem solving and finding creative new ways to do things that have been done before. </p>

    <h3> Where Am I Now? </h3>
    <p>Before I graduated, I purchased a manufactured home in a rural area that had affordable lot rent. I then soent the next 4 months renovating that mobile home so it would be livable for my partner and I, and hopefully be a decent and affordable place for my mother to retire to, if possible. </p>

    <p> The last three months or so I've spent delovering groceries from Walmart to people via the gig app Spark. It has kept me outside more often and provided a decent source of income.</p>
