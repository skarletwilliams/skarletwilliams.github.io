## About Me
<img src="images/prof_grad_photo.jpg" alt="Photo of Skarlet at Graduation">
<p> Hello! My name is Skarlet Williams. I'm a software engineer, gamer, and artist.
My free time is spent reading books, drawing, and playing games. The games I am currently playing mostly consist of Tears of The Kingdom and Stardew Valley. </p>

<p>I graduated from Boise State University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science 
and a Minor in Mathematics in December 2024. I am passionate about problem solving and
finding creative new ways to do things that have been done before. </p>

### Where Am I Now?
<p>Before I graduated, I purchased a manufactured home in a rural area that had
affordable lot rent. I figured it would be more affordable in the long run to commute into the city instead of paying city rent.
I was not exactly correct. I thought I new what I was doing, but the more work I performed on the house, the
more problems arose.</p>

<p> I spent the next 4 months renovating the home, redoing the floors
in half of the building and sealing the many leaks in the roof in active snow. I did all of
this myself after extensive research (googling) since I couldn't afford professionals for
all of my newfound problems.</p>

<p>Now that the home is fixed and I've moved in, I've been using an app called Spark to deliver peoples groceries from Walmart.
It's a decent way to pay the bills while I search for my post grad career, and it keeps me busy.</p>
